# non-isothermal
This repository contains the Matlab/Octave code associated with the manuscript:
"An approximate approach to non-isothermal emplacement of km-sized km-deep sills at calderas", by A. Amoruso and L. Crescentini.
It is based on the Matlab code to produce closed form solutions for radial and KGD hydraulic fractures by E. V. Dontsov, which is available from the Dryad Digital Repository at http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gh469.
